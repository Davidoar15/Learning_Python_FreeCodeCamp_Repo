## Objective: Build a hash table from scratch. A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. A hash table works by taking the key as an input and then hashing this key according to a specific hashing function.

# User Stories:

1. You should define a class named `HashTable` with a `collection` attribute initialized to an empty dictionary when a new instance of `HashTable` is created. The `collection` dictionary should store key-value pairs based on the hashed value of the key.
2. The `HashTable` class should have four instance methods: `hash`, `add`, `remove`, and `lookup`.
3. The `hash` method should:
   - Take a string as a parameter.
   - Return a hashed value computed as the sum of the Unicode (ASCII) values of each character in the string. You can use the `ord` function for this computation.
4. The `add` method should:
   - Take two arguments representing a key-value pair, and compute the hash of the key.
   - Use the computed hash value as a key to store a dictionary containing the key-value pair inside the `collection` dictionary.
   - If multiple keys produce the same hash value, their key-value pairs should be stored in the existing nested dictionary under the same hash value.
5. The `remove` method should:
   - Take a key as its argument and compute its hash.
   - Confirm if the key exists in the collection.
   - Remove the corresponding key-value pair from the hash table.
   - If the key does not exist in the collection, it should not raise an error or remove anything.
6. The `lookup` method should:
   - Take a key as its argument.
   - Compute the hash of the key, and return the corresponding value stored inside the hash table.
   - If the key does not exist in the collection, it should return `None`.
