## Objective: Solve the mathematical puzzle known as the Tower of Hanoi. The puzzle consists of three rods and a number of disks of different diameters.
The puzzle starts with the disks piled up on the first rod, in decreasing size, with the smallest disk on top and the largest disk on the bottom.

The goal of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle is moving all the disks to the last rod. To do that, you must follow three simple rules:
   - You can move only top-most disks.
   - You can move only one disk at a time.
   - You cannot place larger disks on top of smaller ones.

# User Stories:

1. You should have a function named `hanoi_solver` that takes an integer representing the total number of disks of the puzzle as the argument.
2. The `hanoi_solver` function should solve the puzzle following the given rules in `2^n - 1` moves, where `n` is the total number of disks.
3. The `hanoi_solver` function should return a string with all the moves taken to solve the puzzle, including the starting arrangement, with each move on a new line. Rods should be represented as lists of integers, (the smallest disk is represented by the number `1` with each rod separated by a space. For example, `hanoi_solver(3)` should return the following:

Example Code
```
[3, 2, 1] [] []
[3, 2] [] [1]
[3] [2] [1]
[3] [2, 1] []
[] [2, 1] [3]
[1] [2] [3]
[1] [] [3, 2]
[] [] [3, 2, 1]
```
